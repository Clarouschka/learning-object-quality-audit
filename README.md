# Learning Object Quality Audit

The objective of the Learning Object Quality Audit project (aka project LOQA) is to develop an opensource framework that can be used to universally evaluate the quality of any Learning Object.

The term **Learning Object** is used here with the broadest meaning to encompass any educational resource, activity and their combination to learn a skill/competency.

If you want to contribute and/or help us build this framework, send us a message at contact@inokufu.com
